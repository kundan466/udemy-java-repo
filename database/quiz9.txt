Ans.There is no difference ,they are equivalent to ech other

Q3.What happens if a table used in a subprogram is dropped?

 RETURN v_avg_sal;
END get_avg_sal;

Ans.the code should have a return type(We need to specify which type of data the function will return right before the IS or AS keywords
)

Q7.Considering the following function :  

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_avg_sal (p_dept_id number) RETURN number AS
v_avg_sal number;
BEGIN
SELECT avg(salary) INTO v_avg_sal FROM employees WHERE department_id = p_dept_id;
UPDATE func_usages SET number_of_usage = number_of_usage+1;
 RETURN v_avg_sal;
END get_avg_sal;
Which of the following code will work fine?
Ans. Functions having a DML operation cannot be called within a SQL query

Q8.Considering the following procedure:

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_department(dept_id pls_integer, dept_name varchar2, manager_id number default 100, location_id number) is

Ans.exec add_department(1000,'New Department',location_id=>1000);

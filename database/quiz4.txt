Q1.Which of these cannot be considered as control structures?
Ans.constarints

Q2.Which of these is the true usage of if clauses?
Ans.if a is null then 
	//statements
    else //statements
    end if ;

Q3.Which type of case statements/expressions is this code considered as?

CASE
  WHEN v_job_code = 'SA_MAN' THEN
    v_salary_increase := 0.2;
    dbms_output.put_line('Salary increase for SA_MAN is:'|| v_salary_increase );
  WHEN v_department = 'IT' and v_job_code = 'IT_PROG' THEN
    v_salary_increase := 0.2;
    dbms_output.put_line('Salary increase for IT_PROG is:'|| v_salary_increase );
  ELSE
    v_salary_increase := 0;
    dbms_output.put_line('Salary increase for others:'|| v_salary_increase );
END CASE;
Ans.searched case statement(because there are lists in conditions of when)

Q4.What is the reason that this code will not work?

DECLARE
  v_job_code        VARCHAR2(10) := 'IT_PROG';
  v_department      VARCHAR2(10) := 'IT';
  v_salary_increase    NUMBER;
BEGIN
  v_salary_increase:= CASE 
                     WHEN v_job_code  ='SA_MAN' THEN 0.2
                     WHEN v_department='IT' AND v_job_code='IT_PROG' THEN 0.3
                   ELSE 0
                   END CASE;
  dbms_output.put_line('Your salary increase is : '|| v_salary_increase);
END;
Ans.Since this is a searched case expression, we cannot write "end case" . We can write "end case" keywords only with case statements.

Q5.Which one is not a type of loops?
Ans.while..in loops

Q6.What will be the output of this code?

DECLARE
v_counter NUMBER(2) := 1;
BEGIN
  LOOP
    dbms_output.put_line('My counter is : '|| v_counter);
    v_counter := v_counter + 1;
    EXIT WHEN v_counter < 10;
  END LOOP;
  dbms_output.put_line('My counter is : '|| v_counter);
END;
Ans.My counter is : 1
My counter is : 2

Q7.What will be the output of this code?

DECLARE
v_counter NUMBER(2) := 1;
BEGIN
  WHILE v_counter < 10 LOOP
    dbms_output.put_line('My counter is : '|| v_counter);
    v_counter := v_counter + 1;
    EXIT WHEN v_counter = 3;
  END LOOP;
END;
Ans.My counter is : 1
My counter is : 2


Q8.Based on the code below, which one is a wrong information?

BEGIN
  FOR i IN REVERSE 1..3 LOOP
    i := i+1;
    dbms_output.put_line('My counter is : '|| i);
  END LOOP;
dbms_output.put_line('The last value of the counter is : '|| i);
END;
Ans.if we write like the code below,the ouput will be from 1 to 3:
	for i in REVERSE 3..1 loop
		dbms_output.put_line(i);

Q9.What will be output of this code?

DECLARE
 v_inner NUMBER := 1;
BEGIN
  FOR v_outer IN 1..3 LOOP
    dbms_output.put_line('My outer value is : ' || v_outer );
    v_inner := 1;
    WHILE v_inner*v_outer < 15 LOOP
      CONTINUE WHEN MOD(v_inner*v_outer,3) = 0;
      v_inner := v_inner+1;
      dbms_output.put_line(' My inner value is : ' || v_inner );
    END LOOP;
  END LOOP;
END;
Ans.since we have written the continue statement before the increment of v_inner, it will not increase becuase when the continue statement is satisfied, it won't increase so it will be an infinite loop

Q10.Which one is wrong for the GOTO satatement?
Ans.you cannot go back with goto statements ,can go only further
